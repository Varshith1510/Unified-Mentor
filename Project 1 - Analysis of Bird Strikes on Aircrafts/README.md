# Bird Strikes on Aircraft Analysis

Welcome to the repository documenting my analysis on bird strikes on aircraft. This project aims to explore data related to bird strikes, visualize key insights, and share findings relevant to aviation safety.

## Overview

Bird strikes pose significant risks to aviation safety, affecting flight operations and passenger safety worldwide. This analysis dives into understanding the frequency, locations, and impacts of bird strikes using available data.

## Analysis and Insights

### Dashboard Overview

I have created an interactive dashboard using Tableau Public to visualize and explore the bird strike data. You can view the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/varshith.p.singh6551/viz/BirdStrikeAnalysis_17199998987550/BirdStrikeAnalysis).
Navigate through different visualizations and filters to explore insights on bird strikes.

### Key Insights

- Close to 69k bird strikes happened b/w the year 2000 â€“ 2011.

- Nearly 85% of bird strikes happened at an altitude level <1000 ft.

- Only 10% of birds remains could be collected.

- The Dallas Airport had the most bird strike incidents reported, close to 3k accidents.

- Majority of the birds involved in an accident were small in size.

- More than 50% of bird accidents occurred when the weather condition was not favorable for flying an aircraft(cloudy/overcast).

- Most bird accidents did not cause the pilot to take any adverse action, i.e. the journey continued.

- Though warnings were issued to pilots in 40% of the bird strikes, the accident could not be avoided.

- Airports incurred the most expense during the year 2001, an amount close to 23M($) .

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the frequency, impacts, and mitigation strategies related to bird strikes on aircraft.
