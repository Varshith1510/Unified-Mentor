This repository contains projects I've worked on during my internship at Unified Mentor as a Data Science Intern.

## Overview
Each project folder contains detailed documentation, code & visualizations related to specific datasets.

## Projects Included

### Project 1: Analysis of Bird Strikes on Aircrafts 

A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take-off or landing roll. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents.
Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. Create a dashboard that visualizes data related to bird strikes on aircraft and provides meaningful insights.

### Project 2: Employee Attrition Analysis

XYZ company which was established a few years back is facing around a 15% attrition rate for a couple of years. And it's majorly affecting the company in many aspects. In order to understand why employees are leaving the company and reduce the attrition rate, build a dashboard which can help the organization in making data-driven decisions.
